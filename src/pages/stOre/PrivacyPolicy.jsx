            Welcome to <strong>TreNdzY</strong>. Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us, and we are fully committed to safeguarding your personal information. 
            This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your data when you interact with our website and services. By using our platform, you consent to the collection, 
            processing, and handling of your information in accordance with this policy.

              This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, contact number, shipping and billing addresses, and payment details. Additionally, we automatically collect certain technical data,
               such as your IP address, browser type, device information, operating system, and browsing behavior on our website. This helps us enhance user experience, track site performance, and detect potential security threats.
                We may also collect information from cookies and similar tracking technologies to personalize content, remember your preferences, and improve website functionality. <br /> <br />{" "}

            <strong>2. How We Use Your Information:</strong>The personal information we collect is primarily used to facilitate and process your orders,
             ensure timely delivery, and provide efficient customer support. We also use your data to personalize your shopping experience, 
             recommend products, and offer promotions tailored to your interests. If you have subscribed to our newsletters, we may send you updates on new arrivals, 
             special discounts, and exclusive offers. Additionally, we process your information to maintain security, prevent fraudulent activities, enforce our terms and policies, 
             and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Usage data collected from website analytics helps us identify trends, improve website design, and enhance overall service quality. <br /> <br />{" "}

            However, in order to provide essential services such as payment processing, order fulfillment, and logistics, we may share your data with trusted partners,
             including payment gateways, shipping providers, and analytics services. These third-party partners are required to use your information solely for the purpose of delivering services

             Our website uses encryption protocols, secure servers, and firewall protection to ensure safe transactions and data storage.
              We also regularly monitor our systems for potential vulnerabilities and security threats. However, while we take all reasonable precautions to safeguard your data,
               no method of electronic transmission or storage is entirely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute protection, and we encourage users to take additional security measures, 
               such as using strong passwords and avoiding sharing sensitive information over unsecured networks. <br /> <br />
